# KeyOptimizer
Library that helps determine effectiveness of keymappings
By assigning an effort to every bigram (in this case going from one key to another) you can figure out
the required effort to type a whole set of sequential text

Use cases:
Find ideal keymapping on a keyboard for english
Find ideal keymapping for programming in a certain/set of languages
Find ideal way to map keys to a controller
Compare qwerty, dvorak and other keyboards to eachother
Find ideal way to map keys to a 10 button finger input (a good way to do virtual reality typing maybe)

This library provides the following:
An easy way to manipulate the sequential text.
Functions to intuitively assign effort to bigrams.
Ability to easily and quickly swap characters around in order to find ideal keymappings.
